# Project-One-Movify

## Description

This project is a front end application that utilizes APIs, Semantic UI CSS framework, Jquery, and Dayjs to search for movies, display search results, and load movie details. It allows the user to search for any movie across all streaming services and access information including the cast, directors, trailers, and release date.

## Installation

Clone to machine.

## Usage

Click on a top movie to see details, or search for a movie in the search bar. When a movie is searched, a list of movies with similar titles is rendered. When a movie is clicked, it will display more details about the movie.
